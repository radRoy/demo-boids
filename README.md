# demo-boids
Demonstration repository of my boids project (part of the course ESC202 simulations in the natural sciences)

## background of this project
read the presentation PDF `Boids.pdf` and refer to the two video files documenting the progress & problems along the way

## running the simulation
- download the code as a .zip file
- extract to another folder
- execute `main.py`
  - you might need to install some python libraries like pygame and numpy

### options to explore the boids' behaviours
- press the right mouse button to place circular obstacles (symbolising trees)
- press the spacebar twice to draw rectangular obstacles (symbolising walls)
- play around with the parameter sliders and the buttons provided
